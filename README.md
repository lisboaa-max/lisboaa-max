Hello friends! My name is Alexsandro Lisboa, and I'm 43 years old. I currently work as an Uber driver, but I'm eager to explore new horizons. 

Although my experience witn Calculus didn't go smoothly for the past 25 years ago, I've always had a strong interesting in computing and finance.
 
Recently, I made the exciting decision to enroll in an online Computer Science course with Codecademy. 

I'm looking foward to gaining knowledge and hands-on experience here. Wishing you all the best!
